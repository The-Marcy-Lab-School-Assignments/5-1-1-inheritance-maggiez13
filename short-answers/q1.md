# Question
What's the difference between an `instance` method and a `class` method?

# Answer
Instance methods and class methods serve different purposes within a class. 

Instance methods are defined within a class and operate on individual instances of that class, using the `this` keyword to access and modify instance-specific properties. They are called on objects created from the class. 

In contrast, class methods are defined with the `static` keyword and are called directly on the class itself, not on instances. These methods are used for functionality relevant to the class as a whole and do not have access to instance-specific data. 


This distinction helps organize code by keeping methods that work on individual objects separate from methods that offer general utility functions for the entire class.

A helpful analogy I found online is that a blueprint for a house design is like a class description. All the houses built from that blueprint are objects of that class. A given house is an instance.
