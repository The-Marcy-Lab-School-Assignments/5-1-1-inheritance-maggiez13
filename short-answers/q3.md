# Question
What is polymorphism? Show an example in a code snippet.

# Answer
Polymorphism allows different classes to share a common interface or method name, while each class provides its own implementation. This flexibility makes it easier to reuse code and design software in modules. It lets us treat different objects in a similar way overall while letting each one behave differently based on its specific type when needed. 

In other words, polymorphism involves method overriding, where a subclass (child class) provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass (parent class). This means the subclass method has the same name and parameters as the superclass method but provides a different behavior or functionality. This allows objects of the subclass to be treated as objects of the superclass, leveraging inheritance while allowing for specialized behaviors in subclasses.

The code snippet I provided in q2 reflects polymorphism as both `Person` and `Athlete` have a `greeting()` method. Despite both classes having the same method name, they behaved differently when invoked. 

```js
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
  makeSound() {
    return 'Some generic sound.';
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  makeSound() {
    return 'Woof!';
  }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
  makeSound() {
    return 'Meow!';
  }
}

// polymorphic behavior
const animal1 = new Animal('Generic Animal');
const dog1 = new Dog('Buddy');
const cat1 = new Cat('Whiskers');

// if subclass doesn't have makeSound() will output "Some generic sound."
console.log(animal1.makeSound()); // Some generic sound.
console.log(dog1.makeSound()); // Woof! 
console.log(cat1.makeSound()); // Meow!

```
