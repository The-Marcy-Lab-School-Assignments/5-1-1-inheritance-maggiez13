# Question
In a code snippet, demonstrate inheritance by creating two classes where one is the parent class and one is the child class.

In your code example, create an instance of the child class and reference/invoke a property/method of the parent class.

# Answer
```js
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name; 
    this.age = age;
  }
  greeting() {
    return `Hello, my name is ${this.name}, and I am ${this.age} years old.`
  }
}

class Athlete extends Person {
  constructor(name, age, sport, yoe) {
    super(name, age);
    this.sport = sport;
    this.yoe = yoe;
  }
  athleticGreeting() {
    if(this.yoe === 1) {
      return this.greeting() + ` I have played ${this.sport} for a year.`;
    } else {
      return this.greeting() + ` I have played ${this.sport} for ${this.yoe} years.`;
    }
  }
}

const person1 = new Person("Mei", 22);
console.log(person1); 
console.log(person1.greeting()); // Hello, my name is Mei, and I am 22 years old.

const athlete1 = new Athlete("Devin", 27, "basketball", 9);
console.log(athlete1);
console.log(athlete1.athleticGreeting()); // Hello, my name is Devin, and I am 27 years old. I have played basketball for 9 years.

const athlete2 = new Athlete("Reed", 22, "soccer", 1);
console.log(athlete2.athleticGreeting()); // Hello, my name is Reed, and I am 22 years old. I have played soccer for a year.
